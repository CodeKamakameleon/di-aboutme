          My family has always been my rock and my greatest comfort. Spending time outside hiking, on the beach,
          and in the water with them is my favorite way to spend my weekends. We love to eat, laugh and holoholo together.

        <p class="card-content">
          Reef Guardians is one of the funnest non-profits I've worked for! They run reef camps during school breaks
          and do everything in their power to educate the public on ocean education including how to snorkel without damaging the reefs
         and pono fishing practices. During the pandemic, we created an online ocean curriculum for children. I was the cultural specialist in charge of connecting to cultural practitioners around the island
          and was in charge of creating much of the cultural curriculum myself.

        <p class="card-content">
          As a teenager, I fell in love with reading. There have been many books and authors that have influenced my writing over the years
          but Sarah J Maas is one of my favorites. Reading her work, among others, made me the author that I am today.
          You know what they say. "If you want to write, read."

          This is my halau or school. We learn a lot about culture, health, and spirituality from our teacher and from each other.
          We learn about different native Hawaiian healing practices such as la`au lapa`au, lomilomi, ho`oponopono and more.
