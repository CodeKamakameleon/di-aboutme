    <p>Dear Rich,</p>
    <p>
      I am writing to you today to propose an idea about your coding bootcamp,
      Dev-island. Though the program is doing and will do wonders for our
      community, I believe that those we serve in the community will thrive even
      more if we all carried around marshmellows. In this letter I will explain,
      in detail, why we should all carry marshmellows around.
    </p>

    <p>
      Marshmellows have a lot of glucose in them which fuels our brains and
      enables us to go throughout our day with energy. On top of that,
      marshmellows are an important ingredient in a staple dish for campers, not
      just in Hawai`i, but around the globe. Additionally, marshmellows, when
      pulled apart and kneaded, make a great alternative to glue. Imagine if one
      of our computers fell apart and nobody had any glue around to fix it. If
      we all carried marshmellows around, we would have more than enough glue to
      repair our computers <em>and</em> we'd have a tasty snack to share. To
      conclude, I believe that we can increase our positive impact by carrying
      marshmellows around everywhere because it fuels our brain, is an important
      ingredient in a <em>very</em> traditional dish, and makes a great glue
      alternative for computer repairation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for your time and consideration of this incredibly serious
      matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

    <p>Mahalo, Kamalani</p>
